PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF VGG BASED DEEP LEARNING MODEL FOR WEED AND CROP CLASSIFICATION

ABOUT WEED CLASSIFICATION
      The Architectural design VGG19 is a deep convolutional neural network consisting of 19 layers with 16 convolution layer and 3 fully connected layer. It was originally designed for image classification tasks and has attained cutting-edge performance on a number of benchmark datasets. However, adding additional fully connected dense layers can improve the model with additional capacity to learn more complex representations of the input data. The proposed modification involves adding two completely coupled dense layers, each with a softmax activation function, after the last convolutional layer. The first dense layer has 512 neurons, while the second dense layer has 256 neurons. After the two dense layers, a with layer of dropouts is added with a rate of 0.5 to minimize overfitting. Dropout randomly drops out a fraction of the neurons in the layer during training, forcing the model to learn more robust and generalizable representations. The proposed modification to the VGG19 architecture has shown improved performance on crop and weed classification tasks, achieving higher accuracy than the original VGG19 model. The added layers provide additional capacity to the model, allowing it to learn more complex representations of the input data, while the dropout layer helps to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. The model trained using the modified VGG architecture obtained an accuracy of 95% while the model trained using CNN architecture produced an accuracy of 88%. Hence the proposed model using the modified VGG architecture obtained 8% higher accuracy than the existing CNN model and it also obtained higher accuracy than the model trained using the standard VGG architecture.
